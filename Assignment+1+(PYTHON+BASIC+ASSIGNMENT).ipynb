    "Ans- A Variable is a store of information, and a String is a type of information you would store in a Variable. A          String is usually words, enclosed with \"\"\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans-  3 Data Types  \n",
    "      \n",
    "      1. List- An ordered sequence of items is called List. It is a very flexible data type in Python. There is no           need for the value in the list to be of the same data type. List datatype is the most exclusive datatype for           containing versatile data. It can easily hold different types of data in Python.  \n",
    "\n",
    "      It is effortless to declare a list. The list is enclosed with brackets and commas are used to separate the             items. \n",
    "\n",
    "      A list can look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "      a = [5,9.9,’list’]\n",
    "\n",
    "      One can also alter the value of an element in the list.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      \n",
    "      2. Tuple- A Tuple is a sequence of items that are in order, and it is not possible to modify the Tuples. The           main difference list and tuples are that tuple is immutable, which means it cannot be altered. Tuples are             generally faster than the list data type in Python because it cannot be changed or modified like list datatype.       The primary use of Tuples is to write-protect data. Tuples can be represented by using parentheses (), and             commas are used to separate the items. \n",
    "\n",
    "      Tuples can look like this:\n",
    "      t = (6,’tuple’,4+2j)\n",
    "\n",
    "      In the case of a tuple, one can use the slicing operator to extract the item, but it will not allow changing the       value. \n",
