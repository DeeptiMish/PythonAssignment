    "Q1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- Functions increases code reusability. This makes programs shorter, easier to read, and easier to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The code in a function runs when it's called.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. What statement creates a function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- To write a Python function, we need a header that starts with the def keyword, followed by the name of the            function, an optional list of comma-separated arguments inside a required pair of parentheses, and a final colon.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     \n",
    "     def function_name(arg1, arg2,..., argN):\n",
    "    # Function's code goes here...\n",
    "     pass\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- A function consists of the def statement and the code in its def clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "     A function call is what moves the program execution into the function, and the function call evaluates to the          function's return value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-There is only one global scope and a local scope is created whenever a function is called.\n",
    "    The scope of global variables is the entire program whereas the scope of local variable is limited to the function     where it is defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- When a function returns, the local scope is destroyed, and all the variables in it are forgotten.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- A return value is the value that a function call evaluates to.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Yes it is possible to have a return value in an expression.In mean(), we don’t use a local variable to store the       result of the calculation. Instead, we use the expression directly as a return value. Python first evaluates the       expression sum(sample) / len(sample) and then returns the result of the evaluation, which in this case is the         value 2.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     def mean(sample):\n",
    "         return sum(sample) / len(sample)\n",
    "     .......\n",
    "     .......\n",
    "\n",
    "     mean([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "     \n",
    "Q8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- If there is no return statement for a function, its return value is None.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- A global statement will force a variable in a function to refer to the global variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q10. What is the data type of None?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The data type of none is NoneType.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- That import statement imports a module named areallyourpetsnamederic.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans-  This function can be called with spam.bacon().\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- we can use Exception Handling to save a program from crashing if it encounters an error by placing the line of        code that might cause an error in a try clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans- The Python try…except clause runs the code under the try clause. If this code does not execute successfully,          the program will stop at the line that caused the error and the except block code will run.\n",
